                                <p>Welcome to our server named SMKN 5 KIEV. For those who don't know yet, this server is
                                    a community aimed at having fun and making friends. The server was created in 2023,
                                    precisely on January 19, 2023, at 6:00 AM.</p>

                                <h4>HISTORY</h4>
                                <p>This server was initially created for a Minecraft server community called
                                    Voxnet.work.
                                    Many Minecraft players from that server joined this Discord server. However, as time
                                    passed, the number of participants decreased. We, the developers, decided not to
                                    continue the Voxnet Minecraft server community. Eventually, we transformed this
                                    server into a place for casual chatting. Just to clarify, Voxnet.work is a Minecraft
                                    server owned by someone else, not mine. It's just that many players from that
                                    Minecraft server joined this server. That's roughly how it happened.</p>

                                <h4>FOUNDER</h4>
                                <p>I am the creator of this server. Initially, I created this server for playing
                                    Minecraft together with my friends.
                                    However, as it became more popular over time, I decided to turn this server into a
                                    Minecraft community. But as I
                                    mentioned, over time, fewer people started joining after I established the Minecraft
                                    community, due to certain reasons.
                                    So, I began to change the server from being a Minecraft community server to just a
                                    regular community server.</p>
